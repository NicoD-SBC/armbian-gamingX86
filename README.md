# armbian-gamingX86
Gaming script for Armbian X86

This script is written for Armbian Jammy. Might work on other Debian based distro's, but no support for that

This can install the following :

1. Install Steam client for Linux X86
2. Build PPSSPP PSP emulator
3. Build Retropie
4. Build Xonotic

Download the script and run with :
/bin/bash ./armbian-gamingX86.sh

To start steam just type "steam" in terminal
To start PPSSPP type PPSSPPSDL in terminal
To start Retropie type "emulationstation" in terminal
To start Xonotic go to xonotic folder there : ./all run
